### Project Overview

 **About the project:**

Aim of the project is to predict the customer satisfaction based on the information regarding the clothes. Following steps have been followed in reaching to the desired result:

- Load the dataset

- Data preprocessing -  identify the missing values and remove the columns have high percentage of values missing

- Splitting the data into train and test set

- Visualize the dataset , plot the category wise distribution of the fit

-  Impute the missing values for both categorical columns and numerical columns

-  Modify the lable to keep only the index of records , available in the features

- Model Building , fit and predict the label .

-  Calculate the accuracy of the model

-  Select the best model by cross validation using GridSearchCV

-  Fit and calculate the accuracy
